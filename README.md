# Purchase Churn Project

An internet service provider wants to run a win back campaing. With this in mind they historic purchase data of their clients,
from this purchase data,the Customer wants to segements their customers into 3 main categories.

1. 30 day Purchase
2. 90 day Purchase
3. 150 day Purchase

According to the Customers definition of a **PURCHASE CHURN**, it refers to customers who have not made purchase over 150 days.
Our duty as Data Science consultant is to do two things.

1. **Analyse data**:

We are going to analyze this data, suggest which data bundles should be advertised to which client after we have segmented them.
We will then do what we can **operation save**.With **Operation save**, we will look at customers whose last purchase is between **150 -180days**.
Due to the purchase behavior of the general historic data, we will recommend the lowest and cheap bundle to be advertised to these clients.
We will also suggest if clients can have a special offer to win them back.
This will be done after we have given details of customer purchase behaviour.

2. **ML module**:

We will build a Machine Learning Module for our Customer. This Module is to help Customer predict Purchase Churn before it happens.
With this we believe our client can be able to reduce their current churn rate and be proactive.

## Tech Stack:
1. SQL 

2. PYTHON

3. TABLEAU

SQL: We will use SQL Queries to extract data from Customers Data Base.

PYTHON: We will use Python for our Data Analysis and Building of ML Modules.

TABLEAU: To create various dash boards to visualize our analysis.
